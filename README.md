System objectives:

      * Simulate an EDF or CBS scheduler;
      * The system should support two types o tasks, tasks with device time and without device time;
      * System should support a single core CPU with energy and temperature models;
      * Tasks should be generated at least with UNNIFAST algorithm;
      * Extra devices energy should be take in consideration;
      * CPU time to switch frequency must be counted.
